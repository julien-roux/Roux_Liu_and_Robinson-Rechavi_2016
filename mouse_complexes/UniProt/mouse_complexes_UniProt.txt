Q02248	Ctnnb1 Catnb	SUBUNIT: Two separate complex-associated pools are found in the cytoplasm. The majority is present as component of an E-cadherin/ catenin adhesion complex composed of at least E-cadherin/CDH1 and beta-catenin/CTNNB1, and possibly alpha-catenin/CTNNA1; the complex is located to adherens junctions. The stable association of CTNNA1 is controversial as CTNNA1 was shown not to bind to F-actin when assembled in the complex. Alternatively, the CTNNA1-containing complex may be linked to F-actin by other proteins such as LIMA1. Binds SLC9A3R1. Interacts with PTPRU (via the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain) and with EMD. Interacts with SESTD1 and TRPC4. Interacts with CAV1. Interacts with PTPRJ. Interacts with PKT7. Interacts with FAT1 (via the cytoplasmic domain). Interacts with CDK2, NDRG2 and NANOS1. Interacts with NEK2 and CDK5. Interacts with CARM1, CXADR, PCDH11Y and PTK6. Interacts with RAPGEF2. Interacts with SOX7; this interaction may lead to proteasomal degradation of active CTNNB1 and thus inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin-stimulated transcription. Identified in a complex with HINT1 and MITF. Interacts with FHIT. Interacts with FERMT2. Identified in a complex with TCF4 and FERMT2. Another cytoplasmic pool is part of a large complex containing AXIN1, AXIN2, APC, CSNK1A1 and GSK3B that promotes phosphorylation on N-terminal Ser and Thr residues and ubiquitination of CTNNB1 via BTRC and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Wnt-dependent activation of DVL antagonizes the action of GSK3B. When GSK3B activity is inhibited the complex dissociates, CTNNB1 is dephosphorylated and is no longer targeted for destruction. The stabilized protein translocates to the nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF-1 family members, TBP, BCL9, BCL9L and possibly also RUVBL1 and CHD8. Interacts with TAX1BP3 (via the PDZ domain); this interaction inhibits the transcriptional activity of CTNNB1. Interacts with AJAP1, BAIAP1 and CTNNA3. Interacts with TRPV4; the TRPV4 and CTNNB1 complex can interact with CDH1. Interacts with VCL. The CTNNB1 and TCF4 complex interacts with PML. Interacts with XIRP1. Binds CTNNBIP and EP300.

Q9ESX5	Dkc1	SUBUNIT: Part of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which contains NHP2/NOLA2, GAR1/NOLA1, NOP10/NOLA3, and DKC1/NOLA4, which is presumed to be the catalytic subunit. The complex contains a stable core formed by binding of one or two NOP10-DKC1 heterodimers to NHP2; GAR1 subsequently binds to this core via DKC1. The complex binds a box H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), which may target the specific site of modification within the RNA substrate. During assembly, the complex contains NAF1 instead of GAR1/NOLA1. The complex also interacts with TERC, which contains a 3'-terminal domain related to the box H/ACA snoRNAs. Specific interactions with snoRNAs or TERC are mediated by GAR1 and NHP2. Associates with NOLC1/NOPP140. H/ACA snoRNPs interact with the SMN complex, consisting of SMN1 or SMN2, GEMIN2/SIP1, DDX20/GEMIN3, and GEMIN4. This is mediated by interaction between GAR1 and SMN1 or SMN2. The SMN complex may be required for correct assembly of the H/ACA snoRNP complex.

Q3UHX8	Nkx6-3	
Q2LKV2	Nlrp1b Nalp1b	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Classical inflammasomes consist of a signal sensor component, an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and possibly CASP4/CASP11). CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In NLRP1 inflammasome, the role of PYCARD is not clear. Following activation, Nlrp1b may directly interact with CASP1 to form a functional inflammasome. Hence PYCARD may not be necessary for NLRP1 and CASP1 interaction, but is required for speck formation and full inflammasome activity (By similarity). However, allele 4 is missing a CARD domain, which has been shown in other alleles to be involved in the interaction with PYCARD, CASP1 and CASP4/CASP11. It is thus unclear if this allele is able to promote inflammasome assembly (Probable). Homomer (By similarity). Interacts (via LRR repeats) with BCL2 and BCL2L1 (via the loop between motifs BH4 and BH3); these interactions reduce NLRP1 inflammasome-induced CASP1 activation and IL1B release, possibly by impairing NLRP1 interaction with PYCARD. Interacts with NOD2; this interaction may increase IL1B release. Interacts with EIF2AK2/PKR; this interaction requires EIF2AK2 activity, is accompanied by EIF2AK2 autophosphorylation and promotes inflammasome assembly in response to danger-associated signals. Interacts with MEFV; this interaction targets NLRP1 to degradation by autophagy, hence preventing excessive IL1B- and IL18-mediated inflammation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q2LKW6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9C000, ECO:0000305}.

Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Classical inflammasomes consist of a signal sensor component, an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and possibly CASP4/CASP11). CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In NLRP1 inflammasome, the role of PYCARD is not clear. Following activation, Nlrp1b may directly interact with CASP1 (through the CARD domain) to form a functional inflammasome.

Q91WS2	Nlrp6 Nalp6 Navr Pypaf5	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP6 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. The core of NLRP6 inflammasomes consists of a signal sensor component (NLRP6), an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and, possibly, CASP4/CASP11). Within the complex, NLRP6 and PYCARD interact via their respective pyrin domains. This interaction initiates speck formation (nucleation) which greatly enhances further addition of soluble PYCARD molecules to the speck in a prion-like polymerization process. NLRP6 localizes at the end of each PYCARD filament. Clustered PYCARD nucleates the formation of CASP1 filaments through the interaction of their respective CARD domains, acting as a platform for CASP1 polymerization. CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In this complex, the sensor protein is sub-stoichiometric to PYCARD, and PYCARD is further substoichiometric to CASP1, suggesting amplifications of signal transduction from the sensor, via the adapter, to the effector. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q96P20}.

Q2LKU9	Nlrp1a Card7 Nalp1 Nalp1a Nlrp1	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Classical inflammasomes consist of a signal sensor component, an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and possibly CASP4/CASP11). CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In NLRP1 inflammasome, the role of PYCARD is not clear. Following activation, Nlrp1b may directly interact with CASP1 (through the CARD domain) to form a functional inflammasome. Hence PYCARD may not be necessary for NLRP1 and CASP1 interaction, but is required for speck formation and full inflammasome activity (By similarity) (PubMed:23219391). Homomer (By similarity). Interacts (via LRR repeats) with BCL2 and BCL2L1 (via the loop between motifs BH4 and BH3); these interactions reduce NLRP1 inflammasome-induced CASP1 activation and IL1B release, possibly by impairing NLRP1 interaction with PYCARD (By similarity). Interacts with NOD2; this interaction may lead to increased IL1B release (By similarity). Interacts with EIF2AK2/PKR; this interaction requires EIF2AK2 activity, is accompanied by EIF2AK2 autophosphorylation and promotes inflammasome assembly in response to dange-associated signals (By similarity).

The complex contains a stable core formed by binding of one or two NOP10-DKC1 heterodimers to NHP2; GAR1 subsequently binds to this core via DKC1. The complex binds a box H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), which may target the specific site of modification within the RNA substrate. During assembly, the complex contains NAF1 instead of GAR1/NOLA1. The complex also interacts with TERC, which contains a 3'-terminal domain related to the box H/ACA snoRNAs.

Q8R4B8	Nlrp3 Cias1 Mmig1 Nalp3 Pypaf1	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. The core of NLRP3 inflammasomes consists of a signal sensor component (NLRP3), an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and, possibly, CASP4 and CASP5). Within the complex, NLRP3 and PYCARD interact via their respective pyrin domains. This interaction initiates speck formation (nucleation) which greatly enhances further addition of soluble PYCARD molecules to the speck in a prion-like polymerization process. NLRP3 localizes at the end of each PYCARD filament. Clustered PYCARD nucleates the formation of CASP1 filaments through the interaction of their respective CARD domains, acting as a platform for CASP1 polymerization. CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. Reconstituted ternary inflammasomes show star-shaped structures, in which multiple filaments, containing CASP1, protrude radially from a single central hub, containing the sensor protein and PYCARD. In this complex, the sensor protein is sub-stoichiometric to PYCARD, and PYCARD is further substoichiometric to CASP1, suggesting amplifications of signal transduction from the sensor, via the adapter, to the effector (By similarity). Interacts with MEFV; this interaction targets NLRP3 to degradation by autophagy, hence preventing excessive IL1B- and IL18-mediated inflammation (By similarity). Interacts with GBP5 (via DAPIN domain); this interaction promotes inflammasome assembly in response to microbial and soluble, but not crystalline, agents (By similarity). Interacts with EIF2AK2/PKR; this interaction requires EIF2AK2 activity, is accompanied by EIF2AK2 autophosphorylation and promotes inflammasome assembly in response to specific stimuli (PubMed:22801494). Interacts with PML (isoform PML-1) (via the LRR region); PML-mediated increase in NLRP3 inflammasome activation does not depend upon this interaction. Directly interacts with IRF4 (via LRR region); this interaction is required for optimal IRF4 binding to IL4 promoter and efficient IL4 transactivation during differentiation of Th2 helper T-cells (PubMed:26098997). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q96P20, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22801494, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26098997}.

A1Z198	Nlrp1b Nalp1b	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Classical inflammasomes consist of a signal sensor component, an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and possibly CASP4/CASP11). CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In NLRP1 inflammasome, the role of PYCARD is not clear. Following activation, Nlrp1b may directly interact with CASP1 (through the CARD domain) to form a functional inflammasome. Hence PYCARD may not be necessary for NLRP1 and CASP1 interaction, but is required for speck formation and full inflammasome activity (By similarity). Homomer (By similarity). Interacts (via LRR repeats) with BCL2 and BCL2L1 (via the loop between motifs BH4 and BH3); these interactions reduce NLRP1 inflammasome-induced CASP1 activation and IL1B release, possibly by impairing NLRP1 interaction with PYCARD. Interacts with NOD2; this interaction may increase IL1B release. Interacts with EIF2AK2/PKR; this interaction requires EIF2AK2 activity, is accompanied by EIF2AK2 autophosphorylation and promotes inflammasome assembly in response to danger-associated signals. Interacts with MEFV; this interaction targets NLRP1 to degradation by autophagy, hence preventing excessive IL1B- and IL18-mediated inflammation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q2LKW6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9C000}.

Q8C0D0	Trub1	
Q02844	Tpsab1 Mcpt7	
P21845	Tpsb2 Mcpt6	SUBUNIT: Homotetramer. The active tetramer is converted to inactive monomers at neutral and acidic pH in the absence of heparin. Low concentrations of inactive monomers become active monomers at pH 6.0 in the presence of heparin. When the concentration of active monomers is higher, they convert to active monomers and then to active tetramers. These monomers are active and functionally distinct from the tetrameric enzyme. In contrast to the hidden active sites in the tetrameric form, the active site of the monomeric form is accessible for macromolecular proteins and inhibitors eg: fibrinogen which is a substrate for the monomeric but not for the tetrameric form. The monomeric form forms a complex with SERPINB6 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

One of the two pairs of distinct binding sites is occupied either by CNIH2, CNIH3 or CACNG2, CACNG3. The other harbors CACNG2, CACNG3, CACNG4, CACNG8 or GSG1L. This inner core of AMPAR complex is complemented by outer core constituents binding directly to the GluA/GRIA proteins at sites distinct from the interaction sites of the inner core constituents. Outer core constituents include at least PRRT1, PRRT2, CKAMP44/SHISA9, FRRS1L and NRN1. The proteins of the inner and outer core serve as a platform for other, more peripherally associated AMPAR constituents, including VWC2L. Alone or in combination, these auxiliary subunits control the gating and pharmacology of the AMPAR complex and profoundly impact their biogenesis and protein processing. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22632720}.
