ENSMUSG00000069830	Q2LKU9	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Classical inflammasomes consist of a signal sensor component, an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and possibly CASP4/CASP11). CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In NLRP1 inflammasome, the role of PYCARD is not clear. Following activation, Nlrp1b may directly interact with CASP1 (through the CARD domain) to form a functional inflammasome. Hence PYCARD may not be necessary for NLRP1 and CASP1 interaction, but is required for speck formation and full inflammasome activity (By similarity) (PubMed:23219391). Homomer (By similarity). Interacts (via LRR repeats) with BCL2 and BCL2L1 (via the loop between motifs BH4 and BH3); these interactions reduce NLRP1 inflammasome-induced CASP1 activation and IL1B release, possibly by impairing NLRP1 interaction with PYCARD (By similarity). Interacts with NOD2; this interaction may lead to increased IL1B release (By similarity). Interacts with EIF2AK2/PKR; this interaction requires EIF2AK2 activity, is accompanied by EIF2AK2 autophosphorylation and promotes inflammasome assembly in response to dange-associated signals (By similarity). Interacts with MEFV; this interaction targets NLRP1 to degradation by autophagy, hence preventing excessive IL1B- and IL18-mediated inflammation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q2LKW6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9C000, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23219391}.

ENSMUSG00000070390	A1Z198	SUBUNIT: Sensor component of NLRP1 inflammasomes. Inflammasomes are supramolecular complexes that assemble in the cytosol in response to pathogens and other damage-associated signals and play critical roles in innate immunity and inflammation. Classical inflammasomes consist of a signal sensor component, an adapter (ASC/PYCARD), which recruits an effector proinflammatory caspase (CASP1 and possibly CASP4/CASP11). CASP1 filament formation increases local enzyme concentration, resulting in trans-autocleavage and activation. Active CASP1 then processes IL1B and IL18 precursors, leading to the release of mature cytokines in the extracellular milieu and inflammatory response. In NLRP1 inflammasome, the role of PYCARD is not clear. Following activation, Nlrp1b may directly interact with CASP1 (through the CARD domain) to form a functional inflammasome. Hence PYCARD may not be necessary for NLRP1 and CASP1 interaction, but is required for speck formation and full inflammasome activity (By similarity). Homomer (By similarity). Interacts (via LRR repeats) with BCL2 and BCL2L1 (via the loop between motifs BH4 and BH3); these interactions reduce NLRP1 inflammasome-induced CASP1 activation and IL1B release, possibly by impairing NLRP1 interaction with PYCARD. Interacts with NOD2; this interaction may increase IL1B release. Interacts with EIF2AK2/PKR; this interaction requires EIF2AK2 activity, is accompanied by EIF2AK2 autophosphorylation and promotes inflammasome assembly in response to danger-associated signals. Interacts with MEFV; this interaction targets NLRP1 to degradation by autophagy, hence preventing excessive IL1B- and IL18-mediated inflammation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q2LKW6, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9C000}.
