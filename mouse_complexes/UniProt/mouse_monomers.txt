Interacts with VTA1 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O75351, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12594041, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15173323}.
ENSMUSG00000025860	Q60989	SUBUNIT: Monomer, and homodimer. Interacts with DIABLO/SMAC and with PRSS25; these interactions inhibit apoptotic suppressor activity. Interacts with TAB1/MAP3K7IP1 and AIFM1. Interaction with SMAC hinders binding of TAB1/MAP3K7IP1 and AIFM1. Interacts with TCF25 and COMMD1. Interacts with SEPT4 isoform 6, but not with other SEPT4 isoforms. Interacts with RIP1, RIP2, RIP3, RIP4, CCS and USP19. Interacts (via BIR 2 domain and BIR 3 domain) with HAX1 (via C-terminus) and this interaction blocks ubiquitination of XIAP/BIRC4. Interacts with the monomeric form of BIRC5/survivin (By similarity). Interacts with TLE3 and TCF7L2/TCF4 (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

ENSMUSG00000031583	O09053	SUBUNIT: Monomer, and homooligomer. May exist as homodimer, homotrimer, homotetramer and/or homohexamer. Homotetramer, or homohexamer, when bound to DNA. Interacts via its N-terminal domain with WRNIP1. Interacts with PCNA; EXO1 and SUPV3L1 (By similarity). Interacts with PML (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
ENSMUSG00000026175	Q62468	SUBUNIT: Monomer. Homodimer; homodimerization is necessary for actin-bundling. Associates with F-actin; phosphorylation at tyrosines residues decreases the association with F-actin. Interacts (phosphorylated at C-terminus tyrosine phosphorylation sites) with PLCG1 (via the SH2 domains) (By similarity). Interacts (phosphorylated form) with PLCG1; the interaction is enhanced by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). {ECO:0000250}.
ENSMUSG00000020868	Q9EPL0	SUBUNIT: Monomer. {ECO:0000250}.
ENSMUSG00000031913	Q8VEJ9	SUBUNIT: Proposed to be monomeric or homodimeric in nucleotide-free form and to oligomerize upon binding to ATP to form two stacked hexameric or heptameric rings with a central pore through which ESCRT-III substrates are translocated in an ATP-dependent manner. Interacts with CHMP1A, CHMP1B, CHMP2A, CHMP2B, CHMP3, CHMP4A, CHMP4B, CHMP4C and CHMP6. Interacts with VPS4B; the interaction suggests a heteromeric assembly with VPS4B. Interacts with SPAST.
