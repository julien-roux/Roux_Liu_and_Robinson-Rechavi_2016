The CSC has a highly elongated structure with VPS26 and VPS29 binding independently at opposite distal ends of VPS35 as central platform (Probable). The CSC is believed to associate with variable sorting nexins to form functionally distinct retromer complex variants. The originally described retromer complex (also called SNX-BAR retromer) is a pentamer containing the CSC and a heterodimeric membrane-deforming subcomplex formed between SNX1 or SNX2 and SNX5 or SNX6 (also called SNX-BAR subcomplex); the respective CSC and SNX-BAR subcomplexes associate with low affinity. The CSC associates with SNX3 to form a SNX3-retromer complex. The CSC associates with SNX27, the WASH complex and the SNX-BAR subcomplex to form the SNX27-retromer complex (By similarity).
